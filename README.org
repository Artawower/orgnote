* üå± Introduction

What is this project for and who is it for? It's just a system of notes. There's another one. I've tried note-taking in various apps like evernote, notion, obsidian, etc. for quite some time.
Most of them, however, soon enough came to a state of littering. At this point, I simply gave up taking notes of any kind.
After a while, when I got familiar with emacs and discovered org-roam, I discovered that note taking can be done comfortably and easily, without much of a problem with structure.
This project is based on the Zettelkasten approach, and borrows a lot of ideas from emacs + org-roam, allowing you to store notes in the cloud and emacs seamlessly.
