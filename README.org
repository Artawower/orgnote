* üå± Introduction
Great host, smooth check-in. We booked this place just before check-in due to force majeure and the host responded very quickly. The place is close to all necessary infrastructure: train station, grocery shops, restaurants. The place is clean and has everything you need for everyday living.

We stayed with a friend for 2 weeks. We were very satisfied.
